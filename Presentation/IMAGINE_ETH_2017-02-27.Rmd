## What's new since last time

- A more flexible translog function allowing for interactions between inputs
- Control function approach to incorporate a feedback loop between nitrogen and yield
- numerical methods to find optimum nitrogen use
- GYGA environmental control variables 

## Yield gap framework
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "FigTabMap/Framework.png")) 
```


## LSMS-ISA and GYGA

```{r GYGA_map}
Map_GYGA_LSMS
```


## Data

- Two (now three) LSMS-ISA surveys 2011 and 2013 (and as of last week 2015)
- But due to a mistake in recording production in 2011 we only analyse 2013
- Yield defined as production/plot size => different from FAOSTAT/GYGA 

## Summary statistics

\small
```{r,  results="asis"}
# http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10863/is-there-a-way-to-slightly-shrink-a-table-including-font-size-to-fit-within-th
suppressMessages(library(stargazer))
dbsum <- readRDS(file.path(root, "Cache/dbsum.rds"))
stargazer(as.data.frame(dbsum),  type = "latex", digits=2, header=FALSE, title = "Summary statistics")
```
\normalsize



## Methodology


- Three stages in the estimation of the production function
  + First stage Tobit model to avoid feedback loop/confounding 
  + Second stage stochastic frontiers estimation 
    + bootstrapping SEs due to nonlinear first stage function function
    + Numeric solution to find the economically optimal Nitrogen use
  + Third stage policy variables



## Cobb Douglass function

```{r, Fig_3d_CD}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "FigTabMap/CD.png")) 
```



## Translog production function
```{r, Fig_3d_TL}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(root, "FigTabMap/translog.png")) 
```


## Endogeneity

- Idea of a feedback loop between the level of nitrogen applied and the yield
- In econometrics speak: the residuals from the estimation are correlated with the explanatory variable (Nitrogen)
- Agronomic interpretation: Higher yield in good soils, but Nitrogen also works better in good soil confounding
- Policy interpretation: Farmers listen to extension agents and see improvements spurring on more improvements 
- Solution: Instrumental variables style approach, called a control function for a nonlinear first stage regression
    + This requires finding suitable instruments - distance, age, social capital, politics, soil quality??

## Stochastic frontier analysis
\tiny
```{r sfa}
results <- readRDS(file.path(root, "Cache/results_table.rds"))
row.names(results) <- NULL
pander(results)
```
\normalsize


## Stochastic frontier analysis

- Residuals (rd) are significant implying endogeneity indeed exists
- GDD is significant and including GYGA variables controls for climate conditions
- Nitrogen coefficients: level is not significant, square is positive, interaction is negative

## Optimal Nitrogen level and MPP values

\small
```{r,  results="asis"}
by_zone <- readRDS(file.path(root, "Cache/by_zone.rds"))
row.names(by_zone) <- NULL
by_zone$ZONE <- gsub("BENSHANGULGUMUZ", "BG", by_zone$ZONE)
pander(by_zone)
```



## Data issues

- How to solve missing yield potential data?
    + Average values are too low, maximum is too high.
- To calculate feasible yield gap information is needed on the use of inputs when costs are zero:
    + Level of nitrogen when yield diminishes (per region)
    + Use of labour and capital at this point
- Information on nitrogen/fertilizer use can be taken from experimental plot data => input from agronomy colleagues required.
- Use of labour and capital demand assumptions (e.g. 50% increase in labour)




## Yield gap estimations
\small 
```{r relative_YG}
ZonalYieldGap_l_sh <- ZonalYieldGap_l_sh %>%
  rename(FYG = EUYG)
ZonalYieldGap_l_sh$Zone <- gsub("BENSHANGULGUMUZ", "BG", ZonalYieldGap_l_sh$Zone)
knitr::kable(ZonalYieldGap_l_sh, caption = "Relative yield gap", digits = 0)
```
\normalsize




## Closing the yield gap

```{r Gap}
Fig_waterfall
```



## Explaining the TEYG
\small
```{r z_table}
z_res <- readRDS(file.path(root, "Cache/z_res.rds"))
knitr::kable(z_res, caption = "Third stage analysis", digits = 2)
```
\normalsize

## Wrap up

- New and better translog function means more flexibility of inputs
- Optimal nitrogen levels calcualted per farmer using their actual values of other inputs
- Identified and dealt with bias introduced due to endogeneity and feedback loops


## Next steps

- Calculate elasticities of second stage variables to get a better interpretation and add more policy variables (e.g. cost of transportation)
- Slight experimentation with additonal control variables (e.g. use of animal traction)
- Think about how to link policies to yield gaps
- Finish writing paper for ETH meeting.
- Third wave of data???? but ..... time constraints
