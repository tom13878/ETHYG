## What has been done

- Data cleaned
- Some econometric issues solved
- New estimation of sfa model and yield gaps


## Yield gap framework

![](D:/Data/Projects/ETHYG/FigTab/Yield_gap_framework.png)


## Methodology

- Stochastic frontier analysis
    + Controlling for time-constant unobserved heterogeneity (e.g. management skills on yield) by means of correlated random effects framework 
    + Controlling for time-varying unobserved heterogeneity  (e.g. income on use of fertilizer) by means of instrumental variable control function 


## Data

- LSMS-ISA surveys 2011 and 2013
    + Biased (unbalanced) sample for 2011 due to mistake in the survey
    + Yield defined as production/plot size => different from FAOSTAT/GYGA 


## Summary statistics

```{r,  results="asis"}
# http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10863/is-there-a-way-to-slightly-shrink-a-table-including-font-size-to-fit-within-th
suppressMessages(library(stargazer))
stargazer(as.data.frame(dbsum),  type = "latex", digits=2, header=FALSE, title = "Summary statistics")
```
\normalsize


## LSMS-ISA and GYGA

```{r GYGA_map}
GYGA_LSMS
```


## Data issues

- How to solve missing yield potential data?
    + Average values are too low, maximum is too high.
- To calculate feasible yield gap information is needed on the use of inputs when costs are zero:
    + Level of nitrogen when yield diminishes (per region)
    + Use of labour and capital at this point
- Information on nitrogen/fertilizer use can be taken from experimental plot data => literature survey.
- Use of labour and capital demands assumptions (e.g. 10% increase)


## Stochastic frontier analysis
\tiny
```{r sfa}
xtable_m <- xtable[c(1:20),]
knitr::kable(xtable_m, caption = "Frontier yield response model", digits = 2)
```
\normalsize


## Yield gap estimations
\small 
```{r relative_YG}
knitr::kable(ZonalYieldGap_l_sh, caption = "Relative yield gap", digits = 0)
```
\normalsize


## Yield gap estimations
\small  
```{r absolute_YG}
knitr::kable(ZonalYieldGap_s, caption = "Relative yield gap", digits = 0)
```
\normalsize


## Closing the yield gap

```{r Gap}
waterfall
```


## Policies to close the yield gap

## Explaining the TEYG
\tiny
```{r z_table}
knitr::kable(ztable, caption = "Second stage analysis", digits = 2)
```

## Next steps

- Expand sfa model (i.e. translog function and climate variables)
- Solve data issues
- Add additional variables that explain the yield gap
- Calculate elasticities of second stage variables
- Think about how to link policies to yield gaps
- Write paper and policy briefs
